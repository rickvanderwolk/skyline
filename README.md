# Skyline

Last Christmas, I wanted to create something fun to hang in the window. I put together a little skyline (inspired by Ravenstein) with a LED matrix behind it. The lights simulate the weather—like snow or rain—with some extra effects for Christmas and New Year's Eve.

The code’s a bit messy, but it works. Maybe I’ll clean it up someday. For now, it's just archived here in case someone finds it useful.

The effects are made to be viewed from the front. If you're after a side-view LED effect, you might find this useful: https://github.com/rickvanderwolk/led-weather
